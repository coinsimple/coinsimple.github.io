<p>We at CoinSimple believe that the future of payments is decentralized and peer-to-peer. We also believe that the centralized payment processor space is well served, and increasingly crowded. Because of that we have decided to focus on developing products solely for the cryptocurrency space.</p>

<p>What are your options if you are a merchant and want to provide both a decentralized solution (CoinSimple) and a centralized solution like PayPal or Stripe? There are several options but the one that we have found easiest to work with are a combination of Wordpress for your e-commerce store, WooCommerce for the centralized payments, and the <a href="https://github.com/coinsimple/coinsimple-woocommerce">CoinSimple WooCommerce plugin</a> for the decentralized solutions. See a demo of such a set up, without the PayPal integration, <a href="http://woocommerce.coinsimple.com">here</a>.</p>
