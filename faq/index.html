          <h3 id="what-is-coinsimple">What is CoinSimple?</h3>
          <p>CoinSimple allows consultants and online merchants to <strong>easily</strong> accept bitcoins either through a bitcoin payment processor (<a href="http://bitpay.com">BitPay</a>, <a href="http://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>, <a href="http://gocoin.com">GoCoin</a>) or directly to their deterministic wallet (<a href="http://electrum.org">Electrum</a>, <a href="http://bitcoinarmory.com">Armory</a>, <a href="http://www.bitcointrezor.com/">Trezor</a>) or to any non-deterministic bitcoin wallet. One can use the <a href="https://coinsimple.com">CoinSimple web app</a> to issue invoices directly, Wordpress eCommerce (see <a href="http://wordpress.coinsimple.com">demo site</a> or <a href="https://github.com/coinsimple/coinsimple-wpecommerce">plugin page</a>), WooCommerce (see <a href="http://woocommerce.coinsimple.com">demo site</a> or <a href="https://github.com/coinsimple/coinsimple-woocommerce">plugin page</a>), Magento (see <a href="http://magento.coinsimple.com">demo site</a> or <a href="https://github.com/coinsimple/coinsimple-magento">plugin page</a>), to sell products through the respective online stores, or a “Pay in Bitcoin” button on any webpage to accept donations, payments or even sell products.</p>

          <p>CoinSimple does not handle the exchange of bitcoins for the merchants. Instead, it helps merchants integrate  any bitcoin exchange, like <a href="http://bitstamp.net">Bitstamp</a>, <a href="http://anxbtc.com">ANX</a>, <a href="http://mexbt.com/">meXBT</a>, and dozens of others, including BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin.</p>

        <article>
          <h3 id="how-is-coinsimple-different-from-bitpay-coinbase-gocoin">How is CoinSimple different from BitPay, Coinbase, GoCoin?</h3>
          <p>Broadly speaking, <a href="http://bitpay.com">BitPay</a>, <a href="http://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> merchant services, and <a href="http://gocoin.com">GoCoin</a> provide two services:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>merchant processing</strong>, which involves generating unique bitcoin addresses for each transaction and creating invoices on behalf of merchants and</li>
  <li><strong>immediate exchange of bitcoins</strong> into local currencies. (This feature has lead some to call BitPay, and GoCoin, “<em>exchanges</em>”, although the term is not accurate).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Like</em> BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin, CoinSimple provides merchant processing services but it enables it for any bitcoin deterministic wallet (<a href="http://electrum.org">Electrum</a>, <a href="http://bitcoinarmory.com">Armory</a>, <a href="http://www.bitcointrezor.com/">Trezor</a> for now) or any non-deterministic bitcoin wallet (any bitcoin wallet will do). In addition, it alo helps merchants integrate BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin into their store.</p>

<p><em>Unlike</em> BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin, CoinSimple does not handle the exchange of bitcoins for the merchants. Instead, it helps merchants integrate  any bitcoin exchange, like <a href="http://bitstamp.net">Bitstamp</a>, <a href="http://anxbtc.com">ANX</a>, <a href="http://mexbt.com/">meXBT</a>, and dozens of others, including BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin.</p>

<p>Because of the way it performs merchant processing, <strong>CoinSimple never controls any of the customer or merchant funds</strong> (not even for a second). That, along with the ability for a merchant to use any bitcoin wallet, and have complete control over their funds, are the two main differences between CoinSimple and other payment processors.</p>

          <h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-using-coinsimple">What are the benefits of using CoinSimple?</h3>
          <p>The main benefits of using CoinSimple are security, simplicity, flexibility and rich analytics.</p>

<h3 id="security">Security</h3>

<p>CoinSimple never touches client or customer funds.</p>

<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>

<p>You can sign up with CoinSimple and start accepting bitcoin immediately using payment processing directly to your wallet. Later, if your business grows and requires it, you can use bitcoin-to-fiat processors, without losing any information and without any hassle (No developer is necessary to integrate with existing Bitcoin payment processors)</p>

<h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can choose the best bitcoin price for your business  and your customers.</li>
  <li>You have no single-point of failure if one payment processor goes down or if you have problems with one of your wallets.</li>
  <li>You can immediately switch between payment processors if they introduce more benefits.</li>
  <li>You can set your own exchange rate, if you choose so.</li>
  <li>Choose a different wallet or payment processor per invoice</li>
  <li>You can connect any bitcoin exchange and convert your bitcoins to national currency worldwide.</li>
  <li>You can accept more than one cryptocurrency, through integration with GoCoin.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="analytics">Analytics</h3>

<p>Analytics for your customers are kept even if you change the wallet, exchange or payment processor and data is exportable in CSV (Excel format) and Quickbooks formats.</p>

          <h3 id="what-are-the-main-features-of-coinsimple">What are the main features of CoinSimple?</h3>
          <p>CoinSimple enables consultants and merchants to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create email invoices and website payment buttons via the CoinSimple web app.</li>
  <li>Enable Wordpress, WooCommerce or Magento e-commerce stores to accept bitcoin via the CoinSimple plugins.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using CoinSimple, consultants and merchants can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the bitcoin wallet, exchange or payment processor where the bitcoins will be sent.</li>
  <li>Choose the currency that they want to price their invoices and products in. All national currencies and bitcoin are supported.</li>
  <li>Choose the source of bitcoin price. CoinSimple currently supports custom prices as well as prices from <a href="http://bitcoinaverage.com">Bitcoin Average</a>, <a href="http://bitstamp.net">Bitstamp</a>, <a href="https://blockchain.info/ticker">Blockchain.info</a>, <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/price/">Coindesk</a>, <a href="https://bitpay.com/bitcoin-exchange-rates">BitPay</a>, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/charts">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.gocoin.com/">GoCoin</a>.</li>
  <li>Send recurring invoices on a certain day of the month or every certain number of days.</li>
</ol>

<p>All features above are available as a default for every invoice that is generated from CoinSimple, but they can also be changed per invoice.</p>

<p>In addition, inside the web application, CoinSimple users can see analytics data about the total number of invoices that they have issued, how many of those have been paid, and a graph of invoices paid in the last few weeks. All these data can be downloaded for analysis using a spreadsheet, like Excel, or for accounting, using Quickbooks. (Our analytics and data offerings are continuously expanding and improving.)</p>

          <h3 id="what-kind-of-information-does-coinsimple-collect-from-the-merchants">What kind of information does CoinSimple collect from the merchants?</h3>
          <ul>
  <li>To sign up with CoinSimple, a merchant needs to enter an <strong>email, a password and the name of a business</strong>.</li>
  <li>To accept bitcoin payments to any bitcoin address, the merchant needs to share their address with CoinSimple. CoinSimple can generate invoices on behalf of the merchant so that customers can send their payments directly to the merchant’s bitcoin address via either the <a href="https://blockchain.info/api/api_receive">Blockchain.info’s receive payments API</a> or <a href="http://dev.blockcypher.com/">BlockCypher’s payment API</a>. <strong>Naturally, CoinSimple cannot control the funds in the bitcoin address</strong>.</li>
  <li>To accept bitcoin payments using a deterministic wallet (Electrum, Armory, Trezor), a merchant needs to share their <strong>master public key</strong> with CoinSimple. The key word here is <strong>public</strong>. Using the wallet’s master public key, CoinSimple can generate invoices on behalf of the merchant so that customers can send their payments directly to the merchant’s wallet. <strong>But CoinSimple cannot control the funds in the deterministic wallet</strong>.</li>
  <li>To accept bitcoin payments using a payment processor (BitPay, Coinbase, GoCoin), a merchant needs to share their relevant API key with CoinSimple. CoinSimple can then generate invoices on behalf of the merchant so that customers can send their payments directly to the merchant’s account in the payment processor. <strong>Because CoinSimple just generates the payment page from the payment processor on behalf of the merchant, CoinSimple cannot control the funds in the deterministic wallet</strong>.</li>
</ul>

          <h3 id="will-coinsimple-integrate-paypal-or-stripe-payments">Will CoinSimple integrate PayPal or Stripe payments?</h3>
          <p>We at CoinSimple believe that the future of payments is decentralized and peer-to-peer. We also believe that the centralized payment processor space is well served, and increasingly crowded. Because of that we have decided to focus on developing products solely for the cryptocurrency space.</p>

<p>What are your options if you are a merchant and want to provide both a decentralized solution (CoinSimple) and a centralized solution like PayPal or Stripe? There are several options but the one that we have found easiest to work with are a combination of Wordpress for your e-commerce store, WooCommerce for the centralized payments, and the <a href="https://github.com/coinsimple/coinsimple-woocommerce">CoinSimple WooCommerce plugin</a> for the decentralized solutions.
