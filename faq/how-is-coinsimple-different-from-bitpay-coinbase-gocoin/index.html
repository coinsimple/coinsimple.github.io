<p>Broadly speaking, <a href="http://bitpay.com">BitPay</a>, <a href="http://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> merchant services, and <a href="http://gocoin.com">GoCoin</a> provide two services:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>merchant processing</strong>, which involves generating unique bitcoin addresses for each transaction and creating invoices on behalf of merchants and</li>
  <li><strong>immediate exchange of bitcoins</strong> into local currencies. (This feature has lead some to call BitPay, and GoCoin, “<em>exchanges</em>”, although the term is not accurate).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Like</em> BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin, CoinSimple provides merchant processing services but it enables it for any bitcoin deterministic wallet (<a href="http://electrum.org">Electrum</a>, <a href="http://bitcoinarmory.com">Armory</a>, <a href="http://www.bitcointrezor.com/">Trezor</a> for now) or any non-deterministic bitcoin wallet (any bitcoin wallet will do). In addition, it alo helps merchants integrate BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin into their store.</p>

<p><em>Unlike</em> BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin, CoinSimple does not handle the exchange of bitcoins for the merchants. Instead, it helps merchants integrate  any bitcoin exchange, like <a href="http://bitstamp.net">Bitstamp</a>, <a href="http://anxbtc.com">ANX</a>, <a href="http://mexbt.com/">meXBT</a>, and dozens of others, including BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin.</p>

<p>Because of the way it performs merchant processing, <strong>CoinSimple never controls any of the customer or merchant funds</strong> (not even for a second). That, along with the ability for a merchant to use any bitcoin wallet, and have complete control over their funds, are the two main differences between CoinSimple and other payment processors.</p>
