  <li>To sign up with CoinSimple, a merchant needs to enter an <strong>email, a password and the name of a business</strong>.</li>
  <li>To accept bitcoin payments to any bitcoin address, the merchant needs to share their address with CoinSimple. CoinSimple can generate invoices on behalf of the merchant so that customers can send their payments directly to the merchant’s bitcoin address via either the <a href="https://blockchain.info/api/api_receive">Blockchain.info’s receive payments API</a> or <a href="http://dev.blockcypher.com/">BlockCypher’s payment API</a>. <strong>Naturally, CoinSimple cannot control the funds in the bitcoin address</strong>.</li>
  <li>To accept bitcoin payments using a deterministic wallet (Electrum, Armory, Trezor), a merchant needs to share their <strong>master public key</strong> with CoinSimple. The key word here is <strong>public</strong>. Using the wallet’s master public key, CoinSimple can generate invoices on behalf of the merchant so that customers can send their payments directly to the merchant’s wallet. <strong>But CoinSimple cannot control the funds in the deterministic wallet</strong>.</li>
  <li>To accept bitcoin payments using a payment processor (BitPay, Coinbase, GoCoin), a merchant needs to share their relevant API key with CoinSimple. CoinSimple can then generate invoices on behalf of the merchant so that customers can send their payments directly to the merchant’s account in the payment processor. <strong>Because CoinSimple just generates the payment page from the payment processor on behalf of the merchant, CoinSimple cannot control the funds in the deterministic wallet</strong>.</li>
