<p>In addition, inside the web application, CoinSimple users can see analytics data about the total number of invoices that they have issued, how many of those have been paid, and a graph of invoices paid in the last few weeks. All these data can be downloaded for analysis using a spreadsheet, like Excel, or for accounting, using Quickbooks. (Our analytics and data offerings are continuously expanding and improving.)</p>
