### Monero - Stripe for Bitcoin

## Products and Services

The Bitcoin payment industry is growing fast with companies like BitPay, Coinbase and BIPS signing up an increasing number of merchants. (BitPay, for example, grew its merchant base from 1,000 to 10,000 in one year, as mentioned in [this article](http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/16/bitpay-10000-merchants/)) In addition, new payment processors, like BitPagos, GoCoin and Circle [(see this article)](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-jeremy-allaire-circle/) are entering the market. These developments create two market needs.

*First*, merchants need help with selecting payment processors and with integrating the infrastructure of the payment processors into their systems. To address this market need, Monero will offer the following product and service.

1. Bitcoin-to-fiat currency payment plugins that make it easy for merchants to integrate their favorite Bitcoin payment processor (BitPay, Coinbase, BIPS, or others). Plugins will be developed for Wordpress, Drupal and 21 more platforms. Merchants can easily switch from one payment processor to another.

2. Software as a Service, SaaS, for merchants that would like additional features compared to the plugins, for instance, price optimizations. A complementary mobile application that runs using the private API of the SaaS website for point of sale (POS) or person-to-person transactions.

*Second*, payment processors need to sign more merchants and compete more effectively.  To address this market need, Monero will create alliances with the payment processors (BitPay, CoinBase, BIPS, Circle), bring customers to them and ask for referral fees. 

## Target market

The Bitcoin-to-fiat merchant processing market is expanding rapidly and companies around the world can now accept payments. Monero’s focus will be on both existing markets where merchants are looking for options and ease-of-use as well as untapped markets, like Asia.

Our customers are early-adopter companies and marketing to them should happen through specialized forums. Their motivations are to move fast to market and to have a reliable system for accepting Bitcoin.

Our potential partners are merchant processing companies like BitPay, Coinbase, BIPS and Circle and they are interested in the customers that we will bring them. Partnerships with hosting companies like WPEngine and e-commerce companies like BigCommerce should also be considered.

## Competition

Established payment processing companies (Authorize.net for instance) might enter the Bitcoin market. Our approach is to move fast so that Monero could be a strong competitor or subject to acquisition.** **Being first to market gives us an advantage, and forming a strong community of developers that support us will be extremely valuable. Although the barrier to entry for future competitors is currently not that large, our experience in the space will make it larger as time goes on.

## Marketing and Sales

Our marketing messages for our plugin and SaaS customers will be "We put you in control", and  “Stripe for Bitcoin.” For our strategic partnerships, it will be “We deliver great work on time”. 

To market our products we will use trade shows, speaking engagements, networking, social media, licensing agreements and strategic partnerships

For sales, we will outsource lead generation. We will establish an affiliate program and affiliates will get compensated for every referral.

## Financial projections

A detailed outline of the financial projections for one year after the launch of the SaaS product is given [in this spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/1cuewJf). The general categories of expenses include:

1. Marketing, including travel, conference participation and Internet marketing (SEO, SEM, PPC advertising)

2. Payment of contractors for the testing of the plugin products. Deployment to more than 20 platforms will require rigorous testing.

3. For the SaaS product, production costs (servers) and product development, and usability testing

4. For the mobile app, product development and usability testing

5. Sales support for the plugins, SaaS and mobile apps

6. Salaries for the founders

## Team

**[Nikos Bentenitis](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nikosbentenitis), CEO**: Development, Strategy/New Products, Human Resources/Personnel, Marketing Sales,

**[Gabriel Manricks](http://il.linkedin.com/pub/gabriel-manricks/41/334/996), CTO**: Operations, Development

**JM**: Head of Design (Name is redacted because we are still in the initial discussion phase)

As Monero grows, we will add a board of directors and an advisory committee.

## Future development

In the first six months we will finish the development of the SaaS product, establish relationships with developers, customers and payment processors. By the end of the first year, we will have 3,000 merchants using our plugin and 700 using our service.

Our future plans include possibly merging with payment merchant services and forming relationships with Bitcoin-only payment processors and wallets (Inputs.io, Blockchain.info) and Bitcoin exchanges (Bitstamp, MtGox) to create custom merchant solutions for them.

## Funding

The alpha of our payment plugin for Wordpress is done, see [monero.co](http://monero.co). We are currently seeking funding. 

To develop the plugins and the SaaS, will take 6 months (November 2013 - April 2014.) The costs are $5,975 per month, or approximately 30 BTC/month assuming $200/BTC price. (The detailed breakdown of the monthly costs is given in Table 1 below.) To continue the development, marketing and promotion for six months after the SaaS product has been released, we will need additional 420 BTC. (See row 63 of [this spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/1cuewJf) for the costs during the first six months after the SaaS product has been released.)
