### From Microtransactions to Meganalytics

## Pain

**Merchants want to accept Bitcoin but**

- They need help with comparing, selecting and changing payment processors
- They need help with integrating payment processors
- They need more information about the transactions (analytics)
- They need to analyze large numbers of transactions (mega-analytics)



## Market

Our customer is a merchant who

- has an online store and wishes to accept payments in Bitcoins (or other cryptocurrencies)
- faces a complex and changing payment processing industry that
	- is growing fast (BitPay, Coinbase, BIPS)
    - has new entrants (BitPagos, GoCoin, Circle)
- does not have the technical skills to compare, select and integrate a payment processor
- has to integrate the payment processors *separately* (so switching between them is impossible)
- does not have the technical skills the manage the information generated from such a system



## Products and services

1. Bitcoin-to-local currency payment plugins that allow merchants to
	- integrate their favorite payment processor
	- switch from one payment processor to another
	- use them on Wordpress, Drupal and 21 more platforms

2. Software as a Service, SaaS, for merchants that give additional features like
	- big-data customer analytics
	- price optimizations



## Target market

- Monero will focus on both
	- existing markets where merchants are looking for easy-of-switching and ease-of-use
	- rapidly growing Bitcoin markets, like China and Latin America

- Customers are early-adopters and want to have
	- quick and simple integration
	- reliable infrastructure
	- analytics
